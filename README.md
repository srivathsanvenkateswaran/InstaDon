# InstaDon

A Social Media App where you can post your thoughts as text messages. 
The best part is, there is no limit on Characters [unlike Twitter]

This makes use of Firebase Firestore to store all your posts.
You can like the posts made by others, and Edit/Delete the posts you made and if you wish to sign out of the app, you can!

This is a video when a user tested the app.. Not by me with my phone/emulator. This might be a proof that it works everywhere and not just in my emulator..

PS: Till now, only text message support is enabled and Images support, Personalised Account pages features will be implemented in the future....
